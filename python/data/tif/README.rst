TIF envelope

Test-files designed for testing TIF encapsulation

Files have different structure and point of this folder to provide files of all
seen types.

Irregular
---------

Some files seen to be of structure not strictly defined by TIF.


======================= ======================================================
Filename                Description
======================= ======================================================
misalignment.dlis       1 TM before SUL, 0 TMs before LF, 1 TM before every VR,
                        2 TMs in the end, then padding with zeroes. Length of
                        some VRs is not divisible by 4 and 2 additional bytes
                        are required before next TM.

padding.dlis            1 TM before SUL, 0 TMs before LF, 1 TM before every VR,
                        2 TMs in the end, then padding with zeroes

suls.dlis               1 TM before SUL, 0 TMs before LF, 1 TM before every VR,
                        SUL before every LF, 2 TMs in the end

Layout
------

TM can happen in different position according to EFLR and IFLR. Files represent
various situations like that.

=========================== ==================================================
Filename                    Description
=========================== ==================================================
fdata-aligned.dlis          FDATA is present, but VR happens before it.

fdata-disaligned.dlis       FDATA is present, new VR happens in the middle of
                            record

FF01.dlis                   TM contains FF01 bytes. Note that it spoils even
                            length requirement of the VR

LR-aligned.dlis             LR is aligned with VR borders.

LR-disaligned.dlis          LR is not aligned with VR borders.

truncated-after-header.dlis File is truncated right after TIF header

truncated-in-data.dlis      File is truncated in the middle of data

truncated-in-header.dlis    File is truncated inside TIF header
