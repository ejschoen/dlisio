Chapter 3 - Logical Record Syntax
=================================

Testfiles for the general layout of (Explicitly) Formatted Logical Records,
defined in Chapter 3 of rp66v1.

                             contain VR length. Bytes 54 and 55 contain LRSH
                             length. These bytes will be overwritten by the
                             test suite to match the size of the final file.

Files in /implicit                     Description
====================================== ========================================
fdata-broken-obname.dlis               File is truncated in the obname of fdata
                                       record

fdata-encrypted.dlis                   Fdata record is encrypted

fdata-many-in-same-vr.dlis             Several fdata segments in same vr,
                                       including fdata with obname of min and
                                       max length

fdtata-non-0-type.dlis                 Contains implicit record of non-0 type

fdata-vr-aligned-padding.dlis          Simple fdata aligned with Visible Record
                                       border but with present padbytes

fdata-vr-aligned.dlis                  Simple fdata aligned with Visible Record
                                       border

fdata-vr-disaligned-checksum.dlis      Fdata is interrupted by Visible Record
                                       right after obname and lrs has checksum

fdata-vr-disaligned-in-obname.dlis     Fdata obname is interrupted by Visible
                                       Record border

fdata-vr-disaligned.dlis               Fdata which is interrupted by Visible
                                       Record in the middle of data

fdata-vr-obname-trailing.dlis          Fdata obname is interrupted by Visible
                                       Record border with just 1 byte to go and
                                       lrs has trailing length of 2 bytes

Creating a valid .dlis-file
---------------------------

sul.dlis.part or start.dlis.part should be used as the first .part-file when
creating a valid file. Logical Records can then be constructed by adding
components in any order you please, as long as they respect the definitions
form Chapter 3 of rp66v1.
